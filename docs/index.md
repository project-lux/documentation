# LUX Documentation Index


This site provides technical and conceptual documentation for [LUX](https://lux.collections.yale.edu/), Yale Universityâ€™s linked data discovery environment for cultural heritage collections. It covers data modeling across all external and internal sources, and uses the final LUX record to provide examples for  Classes and properties. Whether you're a developer, data specialist, or researcher, these materials are intended to support understanding, reuse, and extension of the LUX system.
